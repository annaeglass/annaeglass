Rosling

In the Hans Rosling, he talked about the difference between preconceived ideas about golobal development and global health. He talked about the Western World and the Third World. What is his comparison and what is his idea of the differences in preconceived ideas and reality?

When teaching global development to undergraduate students in Sweden, Rosling tested their knowledge about child mortality rates in five pairs of countries. He found that the students knew remarkably little about the child mortality rates in these countries because of their preconceived ideas about the Third World. His students had a Western bias and assumed that the Western countries would be much better off than the countries in the Third World, but in some cases, countries that are considered developing have lower child mortality rates. They had divided the two perceived regions of the world into, "Long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life and large family." Vietnam is a stark counterexample to this principle because of trends in family planning that emerged in the 1970s. People living in the West tend to view the Developing World as inherently poor and unchanging, while several countries in the Third World have found economic success through oil, social change, and access to the Internet. 

Which comes first, health or wealth?


Rosling finds several development indicators that are precursors to wealth, including social change to a market economy, access to demanded resources, lower child mortality rates, and, most recently, the number of Internet users per capita. Health is a major indicator of wealth, because without a healthy population, it is difficult to achieve economic growth. A population that faces health crises has less economic freedom, and therefore reduces stimulus to the economy, because the population must spend more of their personal wealth combatting sickness. The quicker the country achieves health, such as reducing child mortality rate or increasing life expectancy, the quicker the growth in the GDP and economic presence. Education and healthcare are labor-intensive endeavors


Health care and education are expensive endeavors, but their long-term benefits can outweigh the short-term costs. 

What is Development? Is this an expansive or a narrower view? Justify.

Accordingto Amartya Sen, development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people can enjoy. This is an expansive view of development because it does not focus on specific development indicators or precursors to development, but instead places an emphasis on the general values, or "ends" that development brings. Amartya Sen argues that development requires the elimination of unfreedoms such as poverty, tyranny, and systematic social deprivation. One can assess development by observing the degree to which distinct freedoms remain present in a developing country. 
 
“Viewing development in terms of expanding substantive freedoms directs attention to the ends that make development important, rather than merely to some of the means that, inter alia, play a prominent part in the process.”

What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires being removed? Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?

Amartya Sen mentions that several limitations of freedom are poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunity, systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities, and intolerance or overactivity of repressive states. He goes on to elaborate on the five times of freedom— political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunties, transparency guarantees, and protective security— and their vitality in the world of development. Free and sustainable agency are major engines of development because they allow the population to achieve a maximized version of satisfaction. This satisfaction can include material wealth, access to healthcare, and ability of expression. Each of these unfreedoms has a direct impact on the individual, and often impairs their development. Armartya Sen claims that there are implicit values that can have a duplicative effect that are not linear agents of development.

What is the importance of markets and freedom of speech?

Markets and freedom of speech are two ways in which a population can express their preferences. When a population contributes to a free market, they control the production and the distribution within their own country. As Sen mentions, “The rejection of the freedom to participate in the labor market is one of the ways of keeping people in bondage and captivity." Amartya Sen adopts a freedom-centered view of economics, where economic freedom coincides with social freedom. Amartya Sen views markets as a natural right, just as freedom of speech is a natural right.

Who were Condorset and Malthus? What were their primary arguments regarding fertility and development? Who was right?

Malthus was a demographer and an economist that believed that population growth is exponential while the resources present on Earth are linear, so the population would eventually outrun the food supply. He believed in imposing strict limits on reproduction in order to control the population and encourage development. Condorcet was a French rationalist who believed that fertility rates would lower and eventually plateau when the population growth no longer supported comfortable development. Malthus and Condorcet believed in opposite ideas about the relationship between population growth and development.
