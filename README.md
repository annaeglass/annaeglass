# Anna Glass' GitHub Index

Hello! My name is Anna Glass and I'm a freshman at William & Mary. I hope to double major in International Relations and Data Science. I have always loved patterns, algorithms, and data, and I am so excited to learn more about the intersection of human development and data science throughout the semester. 

I have a dog named Sofie who is very old and very small. I love hiking, kayaking, playing guitar, and painting in my free time. On campus I'm involved with the International Relations Club and the Courageous Leadership Institue. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester!
