This is my index for DATA 150 Evolving Solutions

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Anna Glass and I'm a freshman at William & Mary. I am hoping to study International Relations and Data Science and do independent language study throughout college. I have always loved patterns, algorithms, grammar, and data, and I am so excited to learn more about the intersection of human development and data science throughout the semester. 

I have a dog named Sophie who is very old and very tiny. I love hiking, kayaking, playing guitar, and painting in my free time. On campus I'm involved with the International Relations Club, the Courageous Leadership Institue, and the Yates Community Council. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester!
