# Owen Barder Development & Complexity Response

## 1. How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?

  Owen Barder expands upon Amartya Sen’s definition of development by first presenting the part of Sen’s definition with which he agrees. Development is the characteristic of enlarging people’s capabilities and freedoms with the ultimate goal of the attainment of a long and healthy life of knowledge and adequate living standards. He elaborates on this development, shifting the definition of development as a characteristic of the political, social, and economic system, not simply the well-being of people within that system. He creates an analogy between Thomas Thwaites’ toaster project and societal institutions to explain that development encompasses not just the individual, but the array of technologies and parts that create a system of wellbeing for the population. Barder also includes a typical definition of development as presented by economists: development is the sum of the effects on individuals and firms in the economy. In this way, Barder includes an economic and institutional lens to Amartya Sen’s definition, which reflects the complexity of development and its relationship with the world outside of the individual level.

## 2. Who was Thomas Thwaites and what was his "toaster project"?  Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of Barder's talk about complexity and development?

  Thomas Thwaites was a British design student who decided that he would try to make an electric toaster from scratch. He attempted to manufacture all of the parts required to make a toaster from raw materials and a model of a dismantled toaster. Thomas Thwaites’ success remains subjective. He succeeded in building a working toaster, but it took him nine months and a hefty cost—several times more than the model toaster, priced at £3.94—and the toaster burst into flames five seconds after he plugged it in. By his own definition, Thomas Thwaites considered this a “partial success.” Thomas Thwaites’ toaster project illustrates the necessity of having an intricate system of government that can transport goods, enforce contracts, and provide capital. It is impossible to achieve development efficiently and sustainably without institutions that specialize in each facet of a functioning society. Development requires the precursor of institutional interworkings to provide the necessary goods and services that one individual cannot produce for themselves. 

## 3. Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010. Why was this example instructive as part of his talk?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate (or invalidate) economic models?

  In Barder’s discussion of the Harrod-Domar growth model, he includes the example of South Korea and Ghana to invalidate its claim that economic growth and economic development are synonymous. The Harrod-Domar growth model presents the idea that to produce a unit of output, a firm must combine a certain amount of capital and a certain amount of labor. Barder asserts that this model remains too simplistic to reflect reality, the example of South Korea and Ghana does not align with the idea that capital and labor combine to create economic output. Despite having a similar income per person in 1960, South Korea grew much faster than Ghana despite having similar constraints on human and material capital. In the late 1970s, incomes in South Korea augmented while they remained stagnant in Ghana, indicating that income per person provides a more accurate model of intrastate economic development. South Korea saw a significant correlation between the rapid increase in income per person and developments in the quality of life. Robert Solow, who introduced the neoclassical growth model, accounts for this third variable of development, technical change.

### 4. What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what the impact of his work on development?  Was the Harrod-Domar model effective at predicting development outcomes?

  The Harrod-Domar growth model was a simple economic model created by economists after World War II. The two fundamental variables in this model were the amount of capital and the amount of labor in society. The Harrod-Domar growth model presented a view of domestic economics as a combination of the two key factors, capital and labor. It assumed that, because developing countries had a wide supply of labor, their economic constraint lied in the amount of capital they possessed. The Harrod-Domar model did not reflect reality or account for the nuanced idea of economic development as distinguished from economic growth. Although the simple model was appealing, it did not present a useful tool for predicting development outcomes. Alternatively, Walter Rostow published *The Stages of Economic Growth,* which presented development as a virtuous circle, where a rise in investment would lead to subsequent rises in capital stock, output, income, savings, and eventually more investment. He theorized that if a developing nation received a 5 to 10 percent increase in their national income, it would launch the country into self-sustained growth. His model provided much of the rationale for the surge of foreign aid in the 1960s and 1970s.
