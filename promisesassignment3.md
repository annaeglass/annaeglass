## Identification of a Plausible Research Gap

One thousand people per hour fled from Libya to Egypt and Tunisia after the Arab Spring; its effects—two million displaced people—continue to ripple across North Africa and the Middle East. Conflict has tangible impacts on migration and displacement; however, these impacts often remain overlooked in analyzing major international events. In its breadth and scope of migration data, data science has the potential to determine the nature of an uprising and expedite intervention from international bodies. The largest obstacle in obtaining this goal: Synthetic population data lacks an understanding of the theoretical literature that drives migration patterns. Specifically, the field would benefit from synthesizing demographic and international relations theory with the procured data that indicates migration push-pull factors. Microcensus data combined with Call Detail Records (CDRs) widens the scope and frequency of migration over time and allows for distance comparison. Though these models seemingly capture a habitual, accurate delineation of population patterns, both methods contain crude elements. 

Andres Garcia’s employment of the gravity-type spatial interaction models represents a step forward but requires severe contextualization. The push-pull factors within a region remain heavily individualized and difficult to quantify on a large scale without implementing survey data alongside mapping. Consider that improved conditions, typically associated with industrialization, lead to higher costs of living. In this case, migration “push” factors may indicate an improved Human Development Index despite the appearance that the location deters residents. Similarly, Amy Wesolowski’s study requires verification that cell phone data usage does not introduce confounding variables. Individuals that regularly engage with cell phone towers represent a wealthier subsection of the population in areas where mobile phone usage remains uncommon. The field has slowly eased its incomplete understanding of small-scale migration patterns by implementing methods across high temporal and spatial resolutions. To model the relationship between political movements and population movements, migration theory and mass data must coalesce to identify whether the determinants of political crises have roots in demographic change.
